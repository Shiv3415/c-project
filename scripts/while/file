Linux was created by Finnish student Linus Torvalds, who wanted to create a free operating system kernel that anyone could use.
It was launched much later than Windows, in 1991. 
Although it still was regarded as a very bare bones operating system, without a graphical interface like Windows. 
With just a few lines of source code in its original release to where it stands today, containing more than 23.3 million lines.
